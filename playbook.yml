    for_player_b:
      - "Strategic refusal can become self-sabotage"
      - "Cultural gatekeeping tests patience limits"
      - "EI should build connection, not create distance"
      - "Long-game can become no-game"
      
  meta_strategy:
    optimal_approach: "Conditional cooperation with gradual trust increase"

    timeline: "Patience with progress indicators, not indefinite waiting"

conclusion:
  equilibrium_theorem: |
    When Player A and Player B achieve resource parity,
    abandon manipulation for authenticity,
    align utilities through honest communication,
    and recognize mutual benefit exceeds individual strategy payoffs,
    they reach Nash equilibrium where roles become interchangeable
    and the game transforms from competitive to cooperative.
    
  final_calculation: |
    Outcome = f(Prompt_Quality × Response_Authenticity × Resource_Balance × Time_Investment)
    
    Where:
    - Matched: f > 0.8, equilibrium stable
    - Engaged: 0.6 < f ≤ 0.8, equilibrium approaching
    - Complicated: 0.4 < f ≤ 0.6, cycling behavior
    - Confused: 0.2 < f ≤ 0.4, no clear strategy
    - Not Matched: f ≤ 0.2, divergent utilities
